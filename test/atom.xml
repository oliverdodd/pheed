		<title type='text'>Durian</title>
		<content type='html'>The kings of myth, legend, and cinema are
			typically the pinnacle of man. Handsome, noble, wise, unwavering;
			faultless creatures that transcend their biological form.&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then there's the occasional deviation, and one
			methinks probably more true to reality: the rotting, decrepit,
			corrupt monarch. Almost as vile in appearance as his foul essence
			within, this is the king who hath inspired many a violent revolution.
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the latter of these two extremes that
			comes to mind when I hear durian described as the king of fruits.
			This is no just and noble monarch but he will certainly bring you to
			your knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="161" height="240" alt="durian waits"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durian is
			legendary, particularly among any community fascinated with strange
			and exotic fruits. In many south-east Asian countries it is illegal
			to carry them on public transport and they are banned from many
			hotels. It's not hard to understand why but upon first glance the
			reasons aren't so obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first encountered
			durian in the flesh at a local flea market. The giant spiky ball was
			far too exotic to resist. I had a sneaking suspicion as to what it
			might be but I wasn't certain. This giant weapon of war had a sweet,
			floral fragrance; definitely not what I had learned to expect. Twelve
			dollars later and the 15 pound monster was dangling from my arm,
			imparting a strange feeling of power. Well, to be honest, there was
			nothing too strange about it. This was nature's version of the
			medieval mace. I could have crushed the skull of any would-be
			attacker looking to steal my day's bounty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;Upon arriving home, the strange treasure was too enticing to
			save for later so I quickly turned to the all-knowing internet to
			identify my catch. And there it was: Durian, the king of fruits, the
			most infamous of the world's edible (and survivable) plant products
			that doesn't illicit some sort of pharmacological reaction (except as
			a possible emetic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="161" height="240" alt="durian spread"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Careful surgery is
			required to pierce the tough, thorny exterior to reach the flesh
			within, particularly if you don't want to damage yourself in the
			process. Regardless of the delicacy of the operation, this surgery is
			best performed outdoors, preferably with materials that are
			disposable or easy to wash. After the first cut, the reason for this
			becomes more than apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the recesses
			of the initial incision flows a stench reminiscent of an open sewer.
			Perhaps a bit more floral, but the stench of rot and sulphur
			dominates the surrounding air. One begins to suspect that this is no
			mere fruit, but the egg of some foul demonic creature.&lt;br

			width="161" height="240" alt="durian flesh"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing a portion
			of the husk to reveal the flesh within does little to quell this
			suspicion. An embryo? A large maggot-like larva? Scrambled eggs? I
			can't be expected to put that in my mouth, can I?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;Yes, that's it, the edible flesh, the king of fruits and the
			source of the foul stench. So what's there to do but hold your nose
			and dig in?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="161" height="240" alt="durian flesh closer"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can I describe
			the taste? While I think about it, here's a few choice quotes from
			other, more gifted scribes on the subject:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;quote&gt;"The five cells are silky-white within, and are
			filled with a mass of firm, cream-coloured pulp, containing about
			three seeds each. This pulp is the edible part, and its consistence
			and flavour are indescribable. A rich custard highly flavoured with
			almonds gives the best general idea of it, but there are occasional
			wafts of flavour that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce,
			sherry-wine, and other incongruous dishes. Then there is a rich
			glutinous smoothness in the pulp which nothing else possesses, but
			which adds to its delicacy. It is neither acid nor sweet nor juicy;
			yet it wants neither of these qualities, for it is in itself perfect.
			It produces no nausea or other bad effect, and the more you eat of it
			the less you feel inclined to stop. In fact, to eat Durians is a new
			sensation worth a voyage to the East to experience. ... as producing
			a food of the most exquisite flavour it is unsurpassed"&lt;/quote&gt;
			- Alfred Russell Wallace&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;quote&gt;"... its
			odor is best described as pig-shit, turpentine and onions, garnished
			with a gym sock. It can be smelled from yards away."&lt;/quote&gt; -
			Richard Sterling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;quote&gt;"Its taste can
			only be described as...indescribable, something you will either love
			or despise. ...Your breath will smell as if you'd been French-kissing
			your dead grandmother."&lt;/quote&gt; - Anthony Bourdain&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And tweeted by the ever-so eloquent and charming
			Steven Fry:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;quote&gt;"&lt;b&gt;@stephenfry:&lt;/b&gt;
			Eating durian fruit by the roadside. A stench straight from Satan's
			anal ring, but a taste from an angel's sugared
			nipple."&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3396466979/"
			title="[don't] eat durian by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3577/3396466979_a9a9f245d7_m.jpg"
			width="240" height="161" alt="[don't] eat durian"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My assessment?
			Rotten egg and banana cream omelette with hints of year old mango
			cheesecake. At least that's what the sweeter, custardy parts taste
			like. The rubbery, egg-like flesh tastes like pure, unadulterated
			rot. But yes, the sweet custard; only mildly reminiscent of raw
			sewage does have a strange quality to it that compels one to eat
			more. There must be some sort of psychoactive effect to this
			odiferous, chemical cocktail to make a person want to keep taking
			bites between the retches. But even more vomit-inducing than the off
			taste is the overpower nature of the stench. More than anything, this
			foul odor permeates and saturates the experience, prompting the
			consumer to plug their nose when venturing to take a bite.&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a

			width="240" height="161" alt="durian maggot"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strictly speaking
			in terms of nutrition, durian doesn't live up to its moniker. It's
			very high in sugar but does a decent amount of Vitamin C, some
			Potassium, and fats. I could understand all the hype if durian was
			some sort of nigh-incredible superfood, the maggot-like sections
			packed with vitamins and minerals but, strangely enough, all of the
			allure seems to be based on the vile flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;There's a wide variety of confections and sweets in southeast
			Asia in which durian is a primary constituent. Now, I've had those
			Harry Potter jelly beans that taste like vomit and other disgusting
			substances but they clearly a novelty. I couldn't even imagine taking
			a mere sip of a durian milkshake no matter how dilute the fetid,
			sewer flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than eating durian which,
			with its ghastly smell and odd flavor, I think nature is trying to
			dissuade us from doing, I think durian should instead be used as a
			weapon of war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exhibit A: its

			array of sharp thorns make it a deadly armament, capable of crushing
			skulls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="161" height="240" alt="durian warrior"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exhibit B: the

			overcome by the stench. And really, why damage the environment with
			manufacturing byproducts and waste all of that metal and plastic in
			the creation and use of tear gas canisters when you could just lob a
			durian into a crowd. They're even a renewable resource.&lt;br

		<title type='text'>Almond Milk</title>
		<content type='html'>Rejoice, here I dispense with the last of the
			more obscure milk substitutes (at least that I know of) so you don't
			have to hear about how much I like Oat Milk ever again... at least
			until I find out someone is making barley milk or quinoa milk or
			something like that. But anyway, I finally got around to buying and
			trying some Almond Milk and now comes the hard part: coming up with
			something to say without repeating myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3412969286/"
			title="almond dream by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3401/3412969286_d8083b6d94_m.jpg"
			width="161" height="240" alt="almond dream"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already
			regurgitated plenty of information on almonds in the &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2009/01/almond-butter.html"&gt;Almond
			Butter&lt;/a&gt; entry and weighed the various qualities of milk
			substitutes in the &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2008/10/oat-milk.html"&gt;Oat
			Milk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2009/02/hemp-milk.html"&gt;Hemp
			Milk&lt;/a&gt; entries so what is there left to say apart from the
			specifics?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, almond milk may be a little
			different from its other milk substitute brethren as very minimal
			processing is required. Take some ground almonds then stick them in a
			blender with water and you're on your way to almond milk. Just don't
			do this with bitter almonds; combining them with water produces
			cyanide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nutritionally speaking, unfortified
			almond milk doesn't quite stack up to its cow borne counterpart but
			it does have fewer calories, even less than soy milk so it's a good
			choice for those on a diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3412969736/"
			title="almond dream by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3349/3412969736_bcdb565c0e_m.jpg"
			width="161" height="240" alt="almond dream"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor? How
			can I say this without stating the obvious? Watery almonds, that's
			what it tastes like. But this isn't as bad as it sounds. Really, the
			flavor is quite pleasant and it actually worked out quite well as a
			tasty, low-calorie addition to my post-workout protein shakes.&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oat Milk still wins for me although I did buy some
			recently, the only brand I've yet to find in US stores, and actually
			didn't enjoy it all too much. It wasn't bad, just didn't compare to
			my past experience with the British champion, the one and only Oatly.
			I hope to find some other brands that will rekindle my love for the
			oat milk but, baring that fortunate turn, I think Almond Milk is a
			close enough second to warrant a switch. But I'm not looking for a
			substitute, just an occasional alternative. As long as there be cows,
			I'll be prepared to drink them dry.&lt;div

		<title type='text'>Longan</title>
		<content type='html'>Longan translates phonetically to "dragon eyes"
			in Cantonese and Vietnamese and "cat eyes" in a few other Southeast
			Asian languages. At first one might think this is due to the rough,
			mottled exterior of this little fruit but the secret to the name lies
			within. Rarely seen within the US, I was fortunate enough to
			encounter these strange little fruits on a recent visit to a local
			flea market where there are a few great stalls featuring some exotic
			Asian produce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			They are grown in the same Southeast Asian lands as their cousins but

			further north than the fertile tropical breeding grounds of their
			family members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longan doesn't
			appear edible at first glance. It isn't until you squeeze these tough
			looking orbs that you start to suspect there might be some viable
			fruit inside. Peeling back the skin is much like peeling a lychee or
			a hard-boiled egg. The rind is thick but pliable and breaks off to
			reveal the dragon's eye inside. The flesh is veined and translucent
			with a dark seed embedded in its center, giving the appearance of an
			eyeball, hence the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste of the
			translucent longan flesh is a little strange. Whereas the flavors of
			the lychee and rambutan are wholly sweet and floral, there's a mild
			tang in the longan. One could aptly describe it as being like a
			lychee with a hint of sweet onion. Not bad, but this odd note
			dampened my enthusiasm about finishing the rest of the bunch.&lt;br

			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some
			bumpier varieties but mine was essentially smooth with some slight
			texturing. The minor pickled-onion flavor puts me off wanting to make
			them a regular part of my repertoire but since my beloved &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2008/05/rambutan.html"&gt;rambutans&lt;/a&gt;
			and lychees are far more expensive, I might be forced to pick up some
			more of these little snack sized fruits on my next trip to the
			market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, if I

		<title type='text'>Red Bull Cola</title>
		<content type='html'>"Cola? Really? Is he really at such a loss for
			ideas?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I have plenty of ideas... and
			plenty of good subjects lined up for when I can scrape together
			enough time to write about them. So stay tuned for more
			excitement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I just ask that you
			humor me for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			class="imgiseverything"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3452822940/" title="red
			bull cola by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3410/3452822940_7caa999cf3_m.jpg"
			width="158" height="240" alt="red bull cola"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn't my
			intention to educate you about the oddness that is cola and this
			still isn't my primary aim, but the fact of the matter is that cola
			is undeniably strange. It's like the chai of soft drinks, a sweetened
			infusion of exotic ingredients. Sugar and spice and everything nice.
			And looking at the cola consumption amongst the youth of today, I'd
			concur that it is indeed what little girls are made of. As for the
			snakes and snails and puppy dogs' tails bollocks, I for one have
			never eaten and will never eat a dog's tail (outside of a nuclear
			holocaust) so I call into question the validity of that ancient
			assessment of little boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cola is named for
			the kola nut, the seed pod of a number of species of African trees
			that are close relatives to the godly South American cacao tree. The
			kola nut, like its cousin, contains caffeine and it is for this very
			reason (and also perhaps because it has euphoric qualities) that its
			bitter extract has long been used as an additive to soft drinks.
			However, it is reported that these days many of the major cola
			companies use an artificial kola flavor and crush up generic No-Doz
			for the caffeine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun Questionable Fact: Most
			pure, isolated caffeine found in your favorite alertness pills and
			energy drinks is a byproduct of the decaffeination of coffee and
			tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="imgiseverything"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3346013864/" title="red
			bull cola by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3663/3346013864_26dee7500a_m.jpg"
			width="159" height="240" alt="red bull cola"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why write about
			Red Bull Cola? Go to the store, or our kitchen, and read the
			ingredient lists on the back of any major cola brand. You're bound to
			see something like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;quote&gt;CARBONATED WATER, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP [or
			SUCROSE, depending on the country), CARAMEL COLOR, PHOSPHORIC ACID,
			NATURAL FLAVORS, CAFFEINE&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What
			the hell does all of that mean? What are natural flavors? Here's what
			the FDA has to say about that from their &lt;a
			href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2002/aprqtr/21cfr101.22.htm"&gt;Code
			of Federal Regulations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;quote&gt;The term natural flavor or natural flavoring means
			the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein
			hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or
			enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a
			spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible
			yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat,
			seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products
			thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than
			nutritional...&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through
			additional rules and regulations, there is no requirement to list the
			foods from which these flavors are derived. But the recently released
			Red Bull Cola is one of the few brands of cola that proudly flaunts
			all flavor constituents on the label and therefore, despite my
			typical blanket avoidance of soft drinks, I was compelled to purchase
			a pack for private experimentation after a quick skim through the
			ingredients. So let's read through them, shall we:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Water, Sugar, Carbon Dioxide,
			Caramel...&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this is pretty
			standard...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;quote&gt;...Galangal...&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;Ok, that's a strange one. Galangal is a root with what is
			described as an earthy citrus flavor with hints of pine and soap.
			It's used in Chinese medicine as a stimulant and aphrodisiac. Odd,
			but that's not what got my attention...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;quote&gt;...Vanilla, Mustard Seed, Lime, Kola Nut, Cacao,
			Licorice, Cinnamon, Lemon, Ginger, Coca Leaf...&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coca leaf? Coca leaf! The scourge of the modern
			world, primary ingredient in &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2008/11/coca-tea.html"&gt;Coca
			Tea&lt;/a&gt; and source of the dreaded compound cocaine (from which
			novocaine and many other incredibly useful painkillers were derived).
			No wonder Red Bull gives you wings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			class="imgiseverything"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3345179115/" title="red
			bull cola by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3623/3345179115_d66aa5a521_m.jpg"
			width="155" height="240" alt="red bull cola"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the coca
			leaves are, of course, decocainized but here we all thought that
			colas no longer used such ingredients. We've been taught to believe
			that the cocaine in early versions of Coca Cola was a myth. Turns out
			they still use coca leaves in their flavoring as well. We've also
			been taught that the USA has a blanket policy barring the import of
			this despicable vegetation. As it happens, the unprocessed leaves are
			imported and then the cocaine is removed in domestic factories. So,
			in essence, the USA is the largest importer and processor of coca
			leaves in the world. And like the processes used to decaffeinate
			coffee beans and tea leaves that result in the production of pure
			caffeine that is used in pills, drinks, and other stimulating foods,
			cocaine is undoubtedly a byproduct of the decocainization process. So
			what happens to it all? What indeed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But
			let's finish up on these ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;quote&gt;...Orange, Corn Mint, Pine...&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As in pine tree? Isn't that crap poisonous? &lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;quote&gt;...Cardamom, Mace, Clove, Lemon Juice
			concentrate, Caffeine from Coffee Beans&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a strange cocktail of exotic spices, the most
			surprising of all being the coca leaf, and it just happens to be the
			most popular drink in the world. But there's potentially a more
			sinister side to it all beyond the multinational/globalization issue
			that people are always up in arms about. It seems as though the cola
			industry might be supporting the drug trade. Them and the bakers of
			poppy seed muffins. Madness.&lt;div

		<title type='text'>Meyer Lemon</title>
		<content type='html'>The graphical depiction of my childhood would be
			sunny and surreal, filled with dry thunderstorms, fires, floods, and
			ferocious fauna. It would also taste like lemons. You see, I grew up
			with a lemon tree in the backyard and, as a consequence, I ate a lot
			of lemons. Yes, ate, I &lt;b&gt;ate&lt;/b&gt; them. In fact, I don't
			really recall drinking much of what is called lemonade in the US
			although I sucked plenty of juice out of raw lemons pulled off the
			tree. But in these circumstances where one experiences beautiful,
			fresh fruit straight from the plant, one also encounters the spoiled
			specimens. I was forever stepping on rotten lemons, feeling their
			brown, leathery exterior give way to the rancid juice inside.
			Naturally, being lemon-scented rot, the off-lemon doesn't smell as
			bad as most decaying vegetation but they don't smell very nice
			either. Our dogs would frequently attempt to eat the fallen lemons
			and then, as happened every time, vomit a yellow foam in the garden
			which you would also inevitably find yourself stepping in.&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="imgiseverything"&gt;&lt;a

			width="240" height="161" alt="meyer lemon"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I sit here
			thinking about my past I realize that my mind categorizes lemons in a
			strange way. Having shared an intimate connection with this fruit I
			hold them in a sacred, high regard but, by that very same token, I
			completely take them for granted. I don't think I've ever bought a
			lemon and I don't feel I should have to buy them. Instead I should be
			able to walk into my backyard and pluck one from a tree. But alas,
			the tree is no more... chopped down a long time ago in a land far
			away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="imgiseverything"&gt;&lt;a

			width="240" height="173" alt="lemon addition"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My non-commercial
			pact with the lemon was slightly broken when I encountered the Meyer
			lemon at a local grocery store. The smooth skin and darker tone told
			me that this was no ordinary lemon which left me both intrigued and
			slightly affronted. It turns out that the Meyer lemon is a hybrid
			between a regular lemon and a mandarin, from which it gets its smooth
			skin and darker hue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically don't do much
			research about the strange foods in this blog before I consume them
			so that can approach them with as little bias as possible
			(fortunately, I violated this self-imposed ignorance before tackling
			the &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2008/12/cherimoya.html"&gt;Cherimoya&lt;/a&gt;
			and spared myself the inconvenience of paralysis or death). So it was
			out of character for me to do some reading about the Meyer lemon
			prior to consuming it because, despite my long history of raw lemon
			consumption, I didn't want to eat the whole thing and figured I could
			find a few interesting ideas to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="240" height="161" alt="meyer lemon cut"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hit jackpot when
			I found an online article from the Los Angeles Times boasting &lt;a
			href="http://www.latimes.com/features/food/la-fo-meyerlemons16jan16,1,7792191.story"&gt;100
			things to do with a Meyer lemon&lt;/a&gt;. With so many to choose
			from, I figured I'd be set so I proceeded to photograph and dissect
			my specimin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had every intention of
			exploring some of the articles suggestions but after my first bite I
			abandoned all plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the fragrance was
			sweet and so was the taste but it was strangely sour as well. Strange
			because I don't mean a typical lemon sour; that tart, lip puckering
			taste we've all , but sour in a rotten way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;div class="imgiseverything"&gt;&lt;a

			width="240" height="161" alt="meyer lemon cut close"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Memories of dead
			lemons and yellow dog vomit came flooding back. I forced another
			couple bites in a vain attempt to acclimate myself to the taste and
			then tipped the copious remains into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;Despite the bad experience, my interest has been piqued about
			what other hybridized lemons are out there but this one won't be
			entering my shopping basket again.&lt;div

		<content type='html'>I'm a simple [minded] man. Upon encountering a
			compound word I, like many of my fellow humans, naturally assume it
			to be a portmanteau word, where the meanings of the root words are
			also combined. One great example of this concept is the spork. Spoon
			+ fork = spork. Even if you'd never encountered such an implement,
			it's easy to imagine what it would look like. Food is not excluded
			from my blind assumptions. After all there are so many examples that
			wholly support my bias. Take for example&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br

			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't do the
			typical breakfast foods but I associate buttermilk pancakes and
			biscuits with creamy buttery goodness since the pictures of said
			items always show a steamy mound of carbs slathered in creamy,
			melting butter. With this association stuck in my mind and my
			biologically driven love for butter, I had always assumed butter milk
			was just as the name implied: some unsalted, half-churned stop off
			between whole milk and butter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn't given
			the stuff much serious consideration until I saw it on the menu at a
			local restaurant. For a week I couldn't get my fabricated idea of
			buttermilk out of my head and I leisurely daydreamed of drinking this
			frothy fat smoothie. It took some frantic searches of a few local
			stores to find it, but on my next shopping trip I was able to secure
			a liter of the mythic buttermilk. Immediately upon arriving home I
			dispensed with the requisite pictures and got down to business.&lt;br

			width="160" height="240" alt="buttermilk"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slight scent
			of salt hit my nose and I initially thought that, like most butter,
			it was just salted but then the culture followed. Sour milk.
			Intentionally sour milk at that. We were dealing not with the formula
			buttermilk = butter + milk. Instead, like many of life's mysteries,
			the answer to the equation x = buttermilk - milk was far less
			obvious. In this case, solving for x would give us an approximation
			of yogurt + salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Wikipedia,
			fount of all modern knowledge:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Buttermilk is a fermented dairy product produced
			from cows' milk with a characteristically sour taste. The product is
			made in one of two ways. Originally, buttermilk was the liquid left
			over from churning butter from cream. In India, buttermilk, widely
			known as "chaas" is known to be the liquid leftover after extracting
			butter from churned curd (dei). Today, this is called traditional
			buttermilk. On the other hand artificially made buttermilk, also
			known as cultured buttermilk, is a product where lactic acid bacteria
			called Streptococcus lactis have been added to
			milk.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, "originally" I wasn't
			as wrong. In the original meaning, the fat was mostly removed from
			the milk/cream leaving a leaner liquid behind, not the fatty broth I
			was dreaming about, and still tart due to the high lactic acid
			concentration. Quite possibly to increase its longevity, the
			beneficial bacteria were added to the mix in other cultures, giving
			it more of a sour, yogurt-like taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drank
			up and I drank deep but by the end of my little glass I couldn't
			stomach the thought of tasting any more until the next day when I'd
			slightly forgotten what it was like. Rather than comparing it to
			yogurt, I guess it would be more apt to describe the texture and
			taste as being like a blended and slightly diluted batch of cottage
			cheese. Not bad, but not something I could drink with any
			regularity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Health nuts take note, it is quite
			a nutritionally sound beverage. There is less fat than whole milk,
			high levels of potassium, vitamin B12, and calcium and the added
			bacteria aids in the absorption of the protein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;So there you have it, further evidence of my shocking ignorance
			but at least I now know to be a little more careful next time when
			making assumptions about foods with compound names (at least I still
			have the &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2008/08/aprium.html"&gt;Aprium&lt;/a&gt;
			to back me up). I think I'll go knock back a few shots of pure cream
			to lift my spirits.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img

		<title type='text'>Buzz Bites</title>
		<content type='html'>I spent my childhood in Australia jealously
			shaking my fist at the fortunate youth across the ocean, the kids in
			America. These kids had it all. Movie stars walking the streets,
			gadgets galore, and a holiday like none other; a holiday where all
			young people prowled the streets in fantastic costumes, collecting
			enormous amounts of FREE candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Australia
			didn't celebrate Halloween when I was young. Oh, we knew about it of
			course, but good luck trying to squeeze some chocolate out of your
			neighbors, you'd be more likely to get hit with an empty beer
			can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in my 10th year of life I was given
			the greatest gift any young Australian child could hope for. No, not
			an anti-venom variety pack; that would be the second greatest. I was
			given the gift of relocation to the holy land: The United States of
			America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I hit the Halloween scene late. At
			first I hated all of the candy. My first of many major illusions
			about the US to be shattered was the realization that you guys have
			it bad in the chocolate bar department... really bad. However, even
			before I became accustomed to the sweets of the land, there were a
			few varieties that stuck out as being the worst of the worst and the
			dreaded Tootsie Roll may very well be at the top of that horrid
			list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the hell are Tootsie Rolls? I know
			they mention something about sugar but, as far as I'm concerned,
			they're just brown colored taffy flavored with the same dirty mop
			water used to make Yoohoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			class="imgiseverything"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3346011860/"

			width="161" height="240" alt="buzz bites wrapper"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAY, this isn't
			about Tootsie Rolls so I'll cut that rant short. However, I needed to
			use these vile little pieces of sugary excrement as a point of
			reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, or perhaps you've already
			seen, I'm a depraved caffeine addict. All you have to do is mention
			the word coffee in a product description and I'm already at the
			checkout, shoving it in my face and looking for my debit card. And
			this is how I was stung by the Buzz Bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buzz
			Bites are little "chocolate" squares that contain as much caffeine as
			a cup of coffee. It even says so on the label through the use of very
			clever symbology. For a more in depth description, this is what the
			buzz bites website says about them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Buzz Bites - Chocolate &amp; Mint Chocolate Energy
			Chews contain a proprietary blend of caffeine, ginseng, taurine and B
			vitamins, which enhance performance, increase endurance, stimulate
			metabolism and sharpen that edge that lets you take on
			life!&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah! Sharpen that
			edge! What am I saying? Who am I to criticize? That's exactly what
			drives me to consume dangerous levels of caffeine in the first place,
			the desire to maximize focus and productivity. So sure, Buzz Bites
			definitely deliver in the caffeine department, but it's how they do
			it that's the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			class="imgiseverything"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3346012014/"
			title="buzz bite by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img

			width="240" height="161" alt="buzz bite"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buzz Bites taste
			like Tootsie Rolls. But wait, that's not all! Buzz Bites taste like
			those "cream filled" Tootsie Rolls but instead of the "creme" filling
			they shoved a caffeine pill inside. At 50 cents or more a pop, you'd
			be better off doing just that yourself. The vile, bitter taffy may
			give you the kick you're looking for but there's no benefit in the
			delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drink a cup of coffee, drink a red
			bull, or swallow a caffeine pill with some chocolate milk. Just don't
			waste your money on these. But if you do decide to &lt;a
			href="http://www.vroomfoods.com/buzz_bites.html"&gt;buy
			some&lt;/a&gt;, I definitely won't turn them down when I'm standing
			at your door with my pillow case in my hands and my moth-eaten bed
			sheets draped over my head.&lt;div

		<title type='text'>Coffee Berry Juice</title>
		<content type='html'>One day I was in the midst of consuming
			excessive amounts of coffee, a regular occurrence, when I started
			wondering about what happens to the fruit surrounding coffee beans
			after they are harvested. You see, coffee beans come from berries
			that look like cherries, little red orbs that grow on a vine. In some
			places civets eat these berries and poop out deliciously adulterated
			coffee beans which are then roasted and sold to rich Americans as
			&lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2008/08/kopi-luwak.html"&gt;Kopi
			Luwak&lt;/a&gt;. But is the flesh of coffee berries/cherries fit for
			human consumption?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after posing this
			question I discovered that &lt;a
			href="http://www.onenaturalexperience.com/"&gt;O.N.E. (One Natural
			Experience)&lt;/a&gt;, makers of the strangely delicious &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2009/01/cashew-juice.html"&gt;Cashew
			Juice&lt;/a&gt; and refreshing &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2009/01/coconut-water.html"&gt;Coconut
			Water&lt;/a&gt;, offer a beverage made from the flesh of coffee
			cherries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			class="imgiseverything"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3345177401/"
			title="coffee berry juice by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img

			width="161" height="240" alt="coffee berry juice"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continuing in
			their line of intriguingly unorthodox and deliciously nutritious
			drinks, &lt;a
			href="http://www.onenaturalexperience.com/"&gt;O.N.E.&lt;/a&gt;
			combine the nutritious coffee fruit, the benefits of which are
			typically destroyed and discarded during the processing of the beans,
			with strawberry puree and Acerola (Amazon Cherry). This mixture of
			fruits results in a potent nutritional cocktail high in antioxidants
			and Vitamin C. In fact, Acerola juice itself contain 32 times the
			amount of vitamin C as an equal volume of orange juice.&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="imgiseverything"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3345177293/"
			title="coffee juice breakfast by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img

			width="161" height="240" alt="coffee juice breakfast"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coffee berries
			themselves are said to be a bit bland but I think I detect some hints
			of the typical astringent qualities of coffee. The flavor of the
			juice is dominated primarily by the strawberry puree which, along
			with the meaty texture, results in a drink that is akin to the
			expensive, exotic juice blends at high end natural food eateries.
			There's about as much caffeine as green tea so, while it won't give
			you a huge boost, there's enough stimulation to kick your brain into
			gear. Add to that the almost paradoxical filling and refreshing
			nature of the beverage and there's no reason not to fill half of your
			refrigerator with cartons of this stuff (the other half, of course,
			being reserved for chilled coffee). Unfortunately, I only have one
			left at the moment but I can't bring myself to drink if because I
			can't stand the idea of not having anymore (I'm in the same situation
			with the Cashew Juice as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			class="imgiseverything"&gt;&lt;a

			width="161" height="240" alt="pour" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing will ever replace coffee as my one true love
			but, not wanting to have a heart attack before I'm 30, I can't very
			well drink it all day. With its delicious flavor, high nutrient
			levels, mild caffeine concentration, and pure convenience, I'd gladly
			make Coffee Berry Juice my beverage of choice in between shots of
			espresso.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1'

		<title type='text'>Heater Meals</title>
		<content type='html'>What happens when a company consolidates various
			edible items from a series of low quality food producers to create a
			gigantic mass of meal for people on the go? Well, you might get
			something like &lt;a
			href="http://www.heatermeals.com"&gt;HeaterMeals&amp;copy;&lt;/a&gt;,
			the self-heating meal that is perfect for anyone lost in the
			wilderness, embedded in a war zone, or hopelessly wandering across
			the charred remains of a post-apocalyptic wasteland.&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="imgiseverything"&gt;&lt;a

			width="161" height="240" alt="heater meal top down"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my birthday,
			many months ago, I was given a HeaterMeals Plus&amp;trade; by a
			co-worker. This may have been because he knows about my penchant for
			trying strange foods. More likely is that, having just returned from
			training with the Army Reserves, it was "leftovers" and he thought it
			would be funny to pass it on. Either way, I was quite grateful to be
			the recipient of such an odd parcel and, noting the expiration date
			of nearly a year later, promptly stuck it in the cupboard to be used
			on some future adventure. Well, the adventure never came and one day
			I was hungry, curious, and looking to free up some cabinet space and
			decided this was the day I would put the self-heating meal to the
			test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Innotech invented their Flameless Ration
			Heater technology, TRUETECH&amp;trade;, in 1990 which has been used
			to heat over 1 Billion Meals for the U.S. Armed Forces. &lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this self-heating technology, Innotech
			developed, copyrighted, and branded an array of ready-to-eat meal
			options including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;HeaterMeals&amp;copy; Self-Heating Meals&lt;/b&gt;
			- "a tasty, nutritious mobile, hot meal"&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;HeaterMeals
			Plus&amp;trade;, The Self-Heating Meal, Plus all The
			Fixings&amp;trade;&lt;/b&gt; - a HeaterMeal with some snacks,
			condiments, and a drink&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;HeaterMeals3&amp;copy;&lt;/b&gt; - a
			HeaterMeal&amp;copy; with a 3 year shelf life&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;HeaterMealsEX&lt;/b&gt;
			(which, curiously, isn't listed with a copyright next to its name...
			I guess they reached their quota on the number of copyright symbols
			one can use on a web page and still be standards compliant) - a
			HeaterMeal&amp;copy; with a 5 year shelf life!&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whew, that was a lot of
			product. Within each of these categories are a variety of meals for
			carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores alike. Some of the options
			include: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Chicken Pasta
			Italiana&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;Green Pepper Steak with

			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the
			"Pancakes, Real Apple Topping &amp; Bacon Slices" from the
			HeaterMealsPlus breakfast series. Weighing in at a whopping 1240
			calories, this is one burly breakfast! Included were two little
			pancakes, some strips of bacon-esque material, trail mix, raisins,
			apple juice, apple topping, a fruit cup, and the TRUTECH&amp;trade;
			heating aparatus itself. There were more raisins and apple products
			than you could shake a stick at. Were these the fruits harvested
			towards the end of the season? Dried grapes and mushy apples rendered
			palatable through desiccation, liquefaction, and juice extraction?
			Well, it's a better fate than letting them go to waste.&lt;br

			width="161" height="240" alt="heater meal steaming"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To heat the food
			you place the appropriate items into the orange heater bag, pour in
			the provided pouch of water, and fold the bag in half to keep the
			heat in and prevent resultant chemical reaction from making a mess.
			At first the steam trickles out slowly but before you know it you're
			witnessing a violent boil. This thing really does get quite hot so
			one must take great care when removing the contents for consumption.
			I'm not a stickler for hot meals and can very well enjoy my food cold
			or tepid (I actually prefer to not heat up leftovers) but I could
			absolutely see this being indispensable in a cold environment where
			lighting a fire is not an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="161" height="240" alt="heater meal prepared"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the food
			itself: basically it tasted like crap. The raisins, fruit cup, juice,
			and trail mix had enough sugar to kill an entire army of diabetics.
			The bacon was like fat jerky and, although it didn't taste too bad,
			it's not something I'd choose to eat again. Although most would
			disagree with me on this point, the pancakes were quite palatable.
			They were dry and rubbery but that just tricked me into thinking they
			were some sort of healthy, whole grain pancakes (is that an
			oxymoron?). But seriously, taste and enjoyability are not the point
			of these meals; this is not food you're supposed to choose to eat.
			You eat HeaterMeals because you have to. Despite my biting criticism
			about the quality of this product, there's no denying how incredibly
			essential it could be in a time of need. So while it may not win out
			in the taste arena (and I must admit, I only tasted one and it could
			very well be the poorest of the bunch) they certainly do excel in
			terms of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Longevity:&lt;/b&gt; 1 - 5 years is a long shelf
			life for a meal and could mean the difference between life or
			death.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nutrition:&lt;/b&gt; sure, not the "healthiest"
			food around but it provides all of the essentials and more for dire
			situations. The high calorie content could again mean the difference
			between life and death.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warmth:&lt;/b&gt; because there's no socket for
			your spot heater out in the wild.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portability:&lt;/b&gt; you can fit a lot of these
			in a backpack, particularly if you ditched the box and sorted
			everything out before packing it, and there's no need for extra
			cooking equipment.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was roughing it or
			surviving in a bind then these types of products would be essential.
			So yeah, they may not taste very nice to the comfortable and well fed
			but these are the best post-apocalyptic meals money can buy.&lt;br

			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I had planned

		<title type='text'>Toasted Coconut Sesame Brittle Ice Cream</title>
		<content type='html'>As a male, I've never understood the whole
			"curled up on the couch with a pint of H&amp;auml;agen-Dazs" method
			to cheering oneself up. If you haven't noticed by reading through
			these expositions on gustatory experimentation, I haven't much of a
			sweet tooth, in fact I can be quite sensitive to sugar, and I am
			prone to freak outs about nutrition. Ergo, ice cream and other
			desserts are not at all comfort food for me, quite the opposite. This
			means I can walk down the ice cream aisle with nary a fear of
			temptation... well, except when it comes to the coffee varieties but
			I've been burned too many times to fall for that again.&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="imgiseverything"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3260413674/"
			title="cocunut sesame ice cream by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3383/3260413674_89c312da3b_m.jpg"
			width="161" height="240" alt="cocunut sesame ice cream"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a few weeks
			ago I was grocery shopping and found myself in a mighty struggle
			against the gods of girth. Breezing past the frozen sweets my eyes
			briefly scanned the word sesame, forcing a double take and a halt for
			further investigation. Toasted coconut and sesame brittle ice cream?
			Upon first seeing this tub of [very expensive] frozen dairy dessert
			amongst a small collection of other [very expensive] exotic varieties
			in the &lt;a
			href="http://www.haagendazs.com/reserve/default.aspx"&gt;H&amp;auml;agen-Dazs
			Reserve Series&lt;/a&gt;, I was immediately enthralled. Sesame seeds
			have long been an ingredient in deserts throughout Asian and Middle
			Eastern cultures but as far as us Western folk are concerned, they're
			what gets sprinkled on top of hamburger buns or, if you're looking to
			be adventurous, fried chicken at Chinese restaurants. That's it, end
			of story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			class="imgiseverything"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3260413724/"
			title="cocunut sesame ice cream by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3485/3260413724_da4202b598_m.jpg"
			width="240" height="161" alt="cocunut sesame ice cream"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being slightly
			unfamiliar with the ways of the sesame, I was very eager to try this
			odd indulgence but slightly afraid of the horrors detailed in the
			nutritional information. Sugars and fats galore with 300 whopping
			calories per serving but in the end my curiosity won out over my
			health concerns and I purchased the tub of [very expensive] ice
			cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;H&amp;auml;agen-Dazs says that their
			inspiration for the Toasted Coconut Sesame Brittle flavor is drawn
			from &lt;i&gt;"the lush islands of Thailand, where coconut trees line
			white beaches and the local markets are filled with exotic Asian
			spices like ginger and sesame."&lt;/i&gt; However, due to the hot
			climate and lack of beach-side refrigeration, the Thai people were
			prevented from coming up with the brilliant idea of mixing this all
			together in a tub of ice cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at
			commodity prices, sesame seeds are far less expensive than I had
			imagined. I mean, you never really see them for sale in Western
			supermarkets except in the aforementioned form of a hamburger bum
			adornment so I figured they were a luxury of sorts. At approximately
			$2.50 per pound for the consumer, it's cheaper than many other seeds
			and grains. But what I did have prior knowledge of was their great
			nutritional profile, particularly when unhulled. While incredibly
			high in fat, the fats are primarily of the monounsaturated variety
			which has been shown to lower LDL [bad] cholesterol levels. Sesame
			seeds are also high in copper, manganese, calcium, magnesium, and
			iron and have significant amounts of zinc, vitamin B1, and vitamin
			E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only are they super nutritious, sesame
			seeds are also super delicious. There's a lot of flavor packed into
			these tiny little seeds. However, I have no idea what one would
			compare said flavor to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			class="imgiseverything"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3260413796/"
			title="cocunut sesame ice cream by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3381/3260413796_ac7083f52a_m.jpg"
			width="240" height="161" alt="cocunut sesame ice cream"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But anyway, onto
			the ice cream itself; this stuff is simply too good. The sesame
			brittle is reminiscent of the tiny, meatless artifacts found within a
			helping of fresh, good quality sesame chicken but with a hint of
			ginger to spice it up. The toasted coconut pieces themselves would
			have made a great singular ingredient in this creamy confection but
			the sesame brittle gives a welcome kick of exoticism, transforming a
			dessert into a delicacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any food of
			this kind, a few bites are enough to satisfy me, too much sweetness
			can put me off for a while, but I found myself visiting the tub more
			frequently than usual throughout the week so that by the time I got
			around to taking pictures it was almost all gone. Had I waited any
			longer, would have been forced to purchase another tub and that would
			have put me in a very, very bad situation. I don't want to buy new
			pants. Like a woman in the midst of a personal tragedy, I think I'll
			have to avoid the ice cream aisle from now on... I don't know if my
			will is strong enough to resist further temptation.&lt;div

		<title type='text'>Thai Guava</title>
		<content type='html'>The thai guava is one ugly fruit. Not ugly in
			the same grotesque vein of an &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2008/05/ugli-fruit.html"&gt;Ugli
			Fruit&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2008/12/cherimoya.html"&gt;Cherimoya&lt;/a&gt;,
			just an "if I found this in the wild I would not be tempted to stick
			this in my mouth" way; mottled green and brown with an odor that
			gives no indication of edibility. But given that it reminded me in
			that sense of a &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2008/06/feijoa.html"&gt;Fieoja&lt;/a&gt;,
			I was optimistic that the flesh contained some secret delight.&lt;br

			width="161" height="240" alt="thai guava"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nutritionally
			speaking, guavas are pretty good food. Packed with vitamin C, vitamin
			A, antioxidants, and fiber, this is something that you should want to
			eat, right? Even the seeds contain a healthy dose of omega-3 and
			omega-6 fatty acids. So I should definitely want to eat this...
			right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I think I left my Thai Guava too
			long before getting around to the eating business. This could
			partially account for the abominable appearance of the skin and a
			slight brown region in the flesh. Undeterred by the slight decay I
			prepared to consume the sparkling white regions untouched by rot.
			Moving my face towards the fruit, the aroma still didn't shout "eat
			me" but I continued my mission and took the first bite.&lt;br

			width="161" height="240" alt="thai guava cut"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap. It tasted
			like soap. So maybe that was just the first nibble or maybe there are
			some complex secondary flavors that explode forth after the enzymes
			in my saliva set about breaking down the chemicals left in my mouth.
			No, still tasted like soap. I couldn't finish and hastily threw the
			rest of the fruit away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was I missing
			something?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some sites liken the taste to a
			pear but I wasn't experiencing anything like that. Ideally I'd sample
			some more in order to make my observations more scientific in a
			sense. But this isn't science, dammit! This is self-righteous,
			opinionated, babble. However, the judgment isn't final as there are
			some other strange varieties of guava that I will certainly try if I
			ever happen to find them available commercially.&lt;div

		<title type='text'>Fritos Chili Cheese Wrap</title>
		<content type='html'>What has this world come to where something like
			the Fritos Chili Cheese Wrap can be suffered to exist? The shock of
			seeing this abomination parading as food in a local circular had me
			journeying to Sonic in a matter of minutes. Being completely out of
			touch with popular culture (and reality in general), I have no idea
			how long this crime against nutrition has been perpetrated but the
			sheer indecency of it left me completely dumbfounded.&lt;br

			width="240" height="161" alt="chili cheese frito wrap"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparing myself a
			couple dollars and few hundred calories, I bought the junior version
			of this foul beat. There's no need to tell you that it bears no
			resemblance the depiction in the menu in terms of, shall we say,
			rotundness. I want to move to the alternate dimension where fast-food
			menu pictures are taken. Even if they serve crap like this at least
			it's big, warm, and inviting as opposed to the tepid, sloppy, grease
			cakes you always end up with. There will be no obesity-epidemic
			finger pointing, multinational corporation condemnations, or
			questions concerning food quality standards here; but having worked
			in fast-food during high school, I should know enough about the
			realities of the food to stay away. However, without any sliver of
			shame I can attest to the fact that it really does serve its purpose
			in times of great need and frugality. Regardless, even in times of
			desperation, I don't think I could stomach the likes of this.&lt;br

			is the meat? Unfolding the thick layers of tortilla I am confronted
			with a bunch of corn chips slathered in a sloppy brown sauce with a
			few small flecks of something that I assume used to belong to a
			mammal. Okay, I know what you're thinking: diarrhea. Yeah, I was
			thinking that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it wasn't

			really don't like Fritos at all so that did factor into my disgusted
			and disgusting reaction to this monstrosity but honestly, it was
			mostly the starch and grease overload that brought me close to
			bringing it all back up. One must assume that there are people out

		<title type='text'>Passion Fruit</title>
		<content type='html'>One day I was walking the dog with the wife and
			happened upon a strange green fruit growing on a vine. "Hmmm...
			what's this? I wonder if I can eat it," I remarked but was summarily
			warned that I would not be transported to the hospital in the event
			of any poisoning. The orb was about the size of a racquetball ball
			and had the same flexible, hollow feel. This oddity puzzled me for
			weeks every time I saw it. What on Earth could it be?&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the kicker: I had seen flowers on that same
			vine before. I knew was these flowers were called yet, in an extreme
			and prolonged case of idiocy, my feeble mind refused to make the
			connection. What was this flower, you ask? The passion flower:&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a

			width="240" height="161" alt="Passiflora incarnata"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the fruit, of
			course, was a passion fruit. Get your iodine lest you end up a cretin
			like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a

			width="240" height="161" alt="passion fruit hangs"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever present as a
			flavoring in fruit drinks, candies, and confections, I was slightly
			puzzled to find that many people I asked had never eaten a passion
			fruit. Strange, since they are actually grown commercially (and
			wildly) in Florida, where I currently reside. When I lived in
			Australia, another big producer, they were in all grocers. But I
			can't remember having seen them in any local supermarkets for years
			and only just recently found a few on the Island of Misfit Produce at
			Whole Foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="240" height="161" alt="passion fruit skin"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two main
			varieties of passion fruit. The purple passion fruit is the most
			commonly known and has the characteristic wrinkly purple skin. It
			only grows to about the size of a lemon whereas its cousin, the
			yellow passion fruit, can grow to the size of a grapefruit. Both
			varieties have a tough, outer rind that contains a clutch of seeds
			coated with a gelatinous, yellow/orange substance. The skin of mine
			was actually a mottled white/purple, something I had not seen before
			and I can only make the logical assumption that it is a cultivar of
			the purple variety. Regardless, just as our mothers told us, it's
			what's inside that matters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="240" height="161" alt="passion fruit seeds and flesh"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juices containing
			passion fruit really do the fresh fruit no justice. The aroma is
			sublimely sweet and floral with hints of mango. One whiff and you'll
			be incapable of resisting the temptation of the sweet flesh. The
			flavor is far more incredible than I had remembered; delectably rich
			and sweet but with a refreshing quality that can't be found in
			equally rich foods. Like a pomegranate, you scoop the innards out and
			consume both flesh and seed. Unlike a pomegranate, the seeds
			contribute favorably to the flavor, adding a slight dash of
			bitterness and sourness to counteract the intense sweetness of the
			flesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="161" height="240" alt="passion fruit weeps"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately,
			there's a meager amount of edible matter and, at a dollar or more a
			pop, there are economic deterrents from just grabbing another for a
			repeat experience. Still, this salacious fruit is one you can quite
			happily take your time to savor.&lt;div

		<title type='text'>Hemp Milk</title>
		<content type='html'>Hippies of the world rejoice, you can now
			legally imbibe the nectar of your gods... somewhat. It seems as
			though hemp has been [justifiably] making inroads into the food
			market, particularly in health food stores, and not solely as a ploy
			to capitalize on the break-up of Phish and the resultant spike in the
			hippie population's disposable income. Who am I kidding? Hippies
			don't have any money to spare. But no need to worry as Hemp Dream, a
			hemp seed based milk substitute, doesn't cost all too much and also
			comes in a sweet tie-dyed container that can double as a decorative
			piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3159177047/"
			title="hemp dream by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3080/3159177047_5811fde1ac_m.jpg"
			width="158" height="240" alt="hemp dream"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hemp seed is a
			great source of Omega-3 and Omega-6 essential fatty acids which are,
			as their name implies, essential for maintaining bodily well-being
			and have an integral link to cardiac health. Essential fatty acids
			cannot be synthesized by the body from other components and therefore
			must be obtained via the diet. Hemp seeds are also said to contain
			all essential amino acids, the very building blocks of life, and
			significant levels of Manganese and Magnesium. In addition to the
			nutrients supplied by the hemp seed itself, Hemp Dream is fortified
			with Vitamins A, B12, D, and Calcium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with
			other milk substitutes, one of the main selling points of hemp milk
			is that it contains no lactose, for the lactose intolerant
			individuals amongst us. (But really, what do you find so intolerable
			about lactose anyway? Don't you think you're being a little too
			biased? It's the year 2009, we're all about tolerance. What did
			lactose ever do to you? Bloating, gas, and cramps? Ok, fair enough,
			but try to be a little more forgiving in the future.) Additionally,
			for those with other allergies or dietary restrictions, hemp milk is
			free of soy, gluten, and cholesterol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really
			enjoyed my carton of &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2008/10/oat-milk.html"&gt;Oat
			Milk &lt;/a&gt; and was looking forward to trying the Hemp Dream out,
			hoping that it could match the Oatly in terms of its taste and
			refreshing quality. Visually the two drinks are very similar. Cloudy,
			off-white, and slightly less opaque than skim milk. The scent is hard
			to pin down. There is a slight vegetative or grainy quality but
			overall it's fairly weak and can only be aptly described as smelling
			wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm torn by the taste. I got the
			unflavored kind in order to better experience the true nature of hemp
			milk but it is also available in chocolate and vanilla. It's not
			drastically different from soy milk, rice milk, or oat milk and has a
			slight nutty flavor. Sometimes I enjoy it, other times I struggle to
			swallow my mouthful. I can't quite discern what quality it possesses
			that occasionally makes me want to retch but I do strongly recommend
			drinking it chilled. As the liquid warms it becomes unpalatable and I
			assume this is primarily a factor of the texture rather than the
			taste. Cold, cloudy water? Should be fine. Tepid, cloudy water?
			That's a no-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a

			width="161" height="240" alt="hemp dream junkie"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as milk
			substitutes go, oat milk gets my firm backing but this one has some
			great nutritional advantages. Strongly recommended for lactose
			intolerant hippies and vegetarians looking for a good source of
			essential fatty acids. However, I urge you to drink with caution.
			Hemp milk is a gateway beverage and can end up ruining your life and
			causing undue harm to your loved ones. But in all seriousness, the
			greater adoption of hemp as a viable food, material, and fuel crop
			would really be in the best interest of us all. Negative associations
			and potential misuse aside, this truly is one incredible plant and
			it's a shame it has been so vilified for its uses as an
			intoxicant.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1'

		<title type='text'>Sour Orange</title>
		<content type='html'>This ugly little orange was sitting with other
			strange and exotic fruits in the produce section of Whole Foods so I
			was lead to believe that there had to be something particularly
			special about it. While not as grotesque as the &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2008/05/ugli-fruit.html"&gt;ugli
			fruits&lt;/a&gt; sitting nearby, these little creatures are
			noticeably rougher than their navel orange brethren; marred with
			black spots and streaks like a mini orange model of the moon. They're
			also incredibly dense. If I'd been attacked in the parking lot on the
			way back to my car then I could probably have used this rock-like
			fruit to fight off my would-be-assailant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3196628350/"
			title="sour orange by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3103/3196628350_b692dee012_m.jpg"
			width="161" height="240" alt="sour orange"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a native of
			Vietnam, I have a sneaking suspicion that the sour orange, also known
			as bitter orange, bigarade orange, or Seville orange, was developed
			as a weapon of war. Currently, however, it is used for its essential
			oil in perfumes and flavorings (one variety, bergamot, is used in the
			delectable Earl Grey tea) or as an ingredient in food items such as
			marmalade. More recently it has replaced the now-illegal ephedra as a
			dietary supplement because of its stimulant and appetite suppressing
			qualities. I can't find much information about the nutritional
			profile but I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that it has high
			levels of vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3195785031/"
			title="sour orange peeled by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3131/3195785031_11823c5609_m.jpg"
			width="161" height="240" alt="sour orange peeled"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In peeling the
			bitter orange, one can certainly begin to understand the value of the
			oil as a perfume or flavoring. The aroma is incredibly strong and
			distinct. At the same time, it is rather harsh and irritating to the
			skin, eyes, and passage ways; the sour orange does not like to be
			peeled and its tough exterior makes it an arduous task. Within the
			thick rind are very pulpy segments with a texture much like that of
			those found in grapefruit. In fact, much about the sour orange is
			similar to the grapefruit; particularly its texture, astringency, and
			taste. The sour orange, however, still has that distinctive "orange"
			scent and flavor that is responsible for its oil's popularity. &lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3196628452/"
			title="sour orange innards by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3439/3196628452_9d3a10a331_m.jpg"
			width="161" height="240" alt="sour orange innards"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rind must be
			where most of the value is contained as the innards indeed smell
			sour, but more along the lines of sour as in rotten. The pulpy skin
			around the juicy flesh is incredibly bitter and not very nice at all.
			After eating two pieces I couldn't stand the taste of the skin any
			longer and resorted instead to chewing the pieces until I'd extracted
			all of the juice and then promptly spat the pulp out. The juice
			itself was pleasant but overbearing at times. If I were to buy
			another one of these then I would definitely forgo the hassle of
			peeling and sectioning. Instead I'd just slice it in twain, juice the
			two halves, and sip slowly. Being so sour, it's probably something
			that can't be enjoyed in isolation all too often but would work quite
			well as an ingredient in meals or cocktails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;While the experience of peeling and eating the sour orange was
			rather unpleasant in and of itself (the tender flesh under my
			fingernails burned for the rest of the day), I've quite enjoyed
			learning about them. Now I shall run to the store and pick up some
			Earl Grey tea because I've got a craving for the sour, citrus
			flavor.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1'

		<title type='text'>Coconut Water</title>
		<content type='html'>My first experience with coconut water came
			during a trip to the dark depths of the Everglades. And by dark
			depths I mean the tourist walkways in the Everglades National Park
			but it was overcast and there were alligators everywhere, one even
			tried to attack me. And by attack me I mean it swam towards me with a
			sinister look in its eye and then disappeared into the murky depths,
			preparing itself to pounce upon me at any moment for being too close
			to its precious baby gators. Seriously, here's a picture of the angry
			mother right before she turned towards me and sank; I imagine she's
			still there at the bottom of that roadside swamp, waiting for me to
			return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="240" height="161" alt="mama gator is a hater"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, seeing all
			of the coconut palms about, our foreign guests told us that you can
			drill a hole in the green ones and drink the water inside. Not only
			is it delicious but it's supposed to be highly nutritious as well. So
			being the adventurous types, we left the safety of the National Park
			and went straight to a roadside market called Robert Is Here to
			lawfully purchase our green coconut. The water wasn't that bad but it
			also wasn't very good either. Rather bland with a heavy consistency;
			not the crisp, mildly sweet, juice we had been expecting.&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3485/3206504460_2a2a79c192.jpg"
			width="500" height="166" alt="robert is here" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day we decided to take it one step further
			with some real adventure and created a teetering tower of flesh in
			order to procure a coconut from a roadside palm in one of the Keys.
			This one turned out to be even more disappointing as there was no
			water in it at all and the flesh didn't taste very nice either. So
			the dream was dead and my curiosity about coconut water disappeared
			with the green flash of the setting sun in Key West.&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img

			width="500" height="146" alt="liberated coconut"
			/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then Whole Foods opened
			up nearby and they carry cartons of the stuff made by a company
			called &lt;a href="http://www.onenaturalexperience.com"&gt;O.N.E.
			(One Natural Experience)&lt;/a&gt; who also manufacture the &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2009/01/cashew-juice.html"&gt;Cashew
			Juice&lt;/a&gt; I previously wrote about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br

			width="161" height="240" alt="coconut water container"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut water is
			the liquid from the innards of of a young, green coconut. The liquid
			and gelatinous meat eventual becomes the solid coconut meat we are
			all used to seeing and from with coconut milk is extracted. While
			mature coconut meat and coconut milk are high in oils, coconut water
			has no fat and it fairly low in calories despite its sweet flavor. It
			is also provides five essential electrolytes: calcium, phosphorous,
			magnesium, sodium, and potassium (of which it has more than a
			banana).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="161" height="240" alt="coconut water in glass"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's not much
			of an aroma beyond a faint smell of vegetation. The liquid is
			slightly cloudy but without coloration. It's easy to fathom why some
			countries offer this as a sports drink because it's quite crisp and
			refreshing. Despite the sweetness, it doesn't suck the moisture out
			of your mouth or burn as drinks high in sugar are likely to do. As
			for the taste, the typical coconut flavor is definitely noticeable
			but there is a more vegetative quality to it; I'm reminded of chewing
			on sugar cane or a mango peel. Overall a nice drink and something
			that could easily serve as a substitute or complement to other more
			common fruit juices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can go for the
			authentic, straight-from-the-coconut experience but, taste-wise, it
			seems to be the luck of the draw. I'd certainly like to try again but
			I'll keep a couple cartons of the prepackaged variety around in case
			of further disappointment.&lt;div

		<title type='text'>Almond Butter</title>
		<content type='html'>I never liked peanut butter much as a youth.
			It's not as popular in Australia and the formula is slightly
			different. During my time as a vegetarian I found the taste of
			America's number one spread growing on me and now I really like the
			stuff (the all-natural variety in particular).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3196628104/"

			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3400/3196628104_f6cc6c5463_m.jpg"
			width="240" height="161" alt="almond"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also being a great
			fan of the almond, another
			not-technically-a-nut-but-called-a-nut-anyway, I have been interested
			in trying almond butter ever since encountering it a few years ago
			but the price tag had put me off. Now that there are some generic
			offerings, the price has come down a bit but it's still exponentially
			higher than peanut butter. This is understandable though as almonds
			come from trees and the crops yield far less than a typical peanut
			crop of similar size, naturally making it a more expensive commodity.
			I was surprised to find that California is the world's largest
			producer of almonds with most others coming from the Mediterranean
			countries of Europe and Africa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a

			width="240" height="165" alt="almond butter"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almonds are often
			touted as nutritional super-foods as they are packed with vitamin E,
			good fats, protein, and dietary fiber. They have also been shown to
			aid in lowering LDL cholesterol levels. These nutritional qualities
			and the fact that they're not peanuts so won't kill you if you have a
			peanut allergy has made almond butter a viable alternative to peanut
			butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="240" height="161" alt="almond butter and knife on crisp bread"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of
			consistency and texture, there's really no difference between the
			additive-free peanut butter and the additive-free almond butter. Both
			have some oil separation and a similar viscosity. Like peanuts in
			peanut butter, the almonds are roasted before being made into a
			paste. Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of roasted almonds and much
			prefer to them "raw" (apparently they're often pasteurized using
			steam, so not technically raw). That being so, I wasn't as enamored
			by this spread as I had hoped. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad at
			all; definitely enjoyable and satisfying, just not as nice for me as
			a handful of raw almonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I
			don't foresee shelling out six or seven bucks for another small jar
			and will happily stick to the big jars of all-natural, additive-free
			peanut butter which is more befitting my palate and budget.&lt;div

		<title type='text'>Bee Pollen</title>
		<content type='html'>Naturopaths and deluded peddlers of
			pseudoscience claim that bee pollen, also called bee bread, is
			nature's most perfect and complete food. Many purport that it
			rejuvenates, invigorates, prolongs life, heals organs, enhances
			athletic and sexual performance, fights infection, and inoculates
			against allergic reactions. That's quite an impressive array of
			medicinal properties packed into such tiny little balls of pollen.
			But there's a flaw to even the most basic claims about the
			nutritional profile of this supplement. Because bees don't typically
			stick to one flower, the composition of the pollen can be very hard
			to ascertain. Therefore, the proclamations that any container of bee
			pollen contains all of the essential amino acids along with high
			values of vitamins and minerals cannot be completely verifiable. And
			because the pollen sources are not known, those with allergies to any
			specific type of pollen run the risk of suffering a severe allergic
			reaction by consuming the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3196628310/" title="bee
			pollen on spoon by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3449/3196628310_cf60e85dd2_m.jpg"
			width="161" height="240" alt="bee pollen on spoon"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, there's a
			&lt;a
			href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/DSH/bee.html"&gt;great
			article here&lt;/a&gt; by an actual doctor debunking the erroneous
			claims put forth by the promoters of bee pollen (which can be found
			en masse with a simple google search). So, crap aside, let's get down
			to the food stuff itself. I'm sure you've seen these little balls of
			spit and honey dangling from the hind quarters of a bee making daily
			nectar rounds in the garden. These are brought back to the hive used
			to manufacture honey, fueling the colony and the future generations
			of bees... that is if they're not stolen by some malicious supplement
			salesmen as the poor, unsuspecting bee arrives home from a hard day
			in the fields.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3159176683/" title="bee
			pollen by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3258/3159176683_4666e2cca7_m.jpg"
			width="240" height="161" alt="bee pollen"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was taken back
			at first upon opening my bottle and smelling the contents and even
			more surprised by the taste. The pollen balls smelled sweet and, get
			this, honey-like so, logically, my reaction didn't make much sense.
			But I could detect no distinct flowery scents nor any other aromas
			one associates with the pollen storms of spring. Noting the smell,
			the flavor and texture should have come as no surprise but this dry,
			chalky honey still caught me off guard. Illogical, yes, but it's hard
			to divorce honey's sweet and pungent flavor from the syrupy texture,
			as if some particular quality of the bee spit is responsible for the
			characteristic taste. But no, here it was in near-raw form.
			Surprisingly nice but not something that remains pleasant after the
			first couple teaspoons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3159176867/" title="bee
			pollen by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img

			width="240" height="161" alt="bee pollen"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't believe the
			hype. If you're interested in trying some bee pollen, approach it as
			food and not some miraculous panacea. I could definitely see myself
			sprinkling it over some ice cream or adding it to the foamy top of a
			fancy coffee concoction. But one must take great care if they are
			prone to pollen allergies. There are cases of people dying after
			having a severe reaction to this food/supplement and there's no
			guaranteeing the composition of the pollen. Proceed with caution and
			skepticism.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1'

		<title type='text'>Cashew Juice</title>
		<content type='html'>Our aspiring city recently took another small
			step forward in modernity with the opening of the region's very first
			Whole Foods. Organic produce, healthy meals, and weird foods galore.
			One late night trip resulted in enough bounty to satisfy my penchant
			for the strange for the next couple months... or at least it will
			have to considering these uneasy economic times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a

			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3195/3146525193_acfefc4228_m.jpg"
			width="161" height="240" alt="cashew juice"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first sampling
			from the lot was a carton of cashew juice. Cashews, like almonds, are
			the seeds of a drupe and not actually a nut although they are
			commonly often referred to as such. This juice is made from the fruit
			part of the cashew which, with the seed dangling down from its nether
			regions, is a strange looking beast indeed. The fruit is high in
			tannins and rather astringent so it requires a bit of processing
			prior to consumption. As a result it is rarely consumed in this part
			of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3147358286/"

			width="157" height="240" alt="cashew juice in cup"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cashew fruit
			contains a high levels of vitamin C and therefore the juice box goes
			on to list a variety of health claims linked to the indigenous use of
			the cashew fruit in South America and vitamin C in general.&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poured into a glass, the juice looks strikingly
			similar to commercially available grapefruit juice but expresses no
			distinct odor. Upon my first sip I actually yelled out in surprise.
			This stuff is incredibly acidic, like a very tart orange juice, an
			effect which is exacerbated by the addition of citric acid.&lt;br

			width="240" height="161" alt="cashew juice in cup"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the first
			mouthful, the taste starts to mellow out a bit and begins to take on
			the characteristics of a poor quality orange juice with an aftertaste
			of nuts. This aftertaste is quite unsettling at first but gets better
			with time. Still, it gives one the sensation of having a mouthful of
			nuts and can remain a little unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I
			know, it sounds bad, but the overall combination of the strange

			daily intake of orange juice with cashew juice. Shocking at first but
			an easy taste to acquire and enjoy.&lt;div

		<title type='text'>Kombucha</title>
		<content type='html'>We here in the Western world are constantly
			turning to the East in search of elixirs that will allow us to live a
			prolonged and healthy life. Sure, there are the yogis and wise men of
			the orient whose lives ultimately span a century or more but really,
			when you're sitting down in the lotus position and remaining calm all
			day then you're bound to live a long, happy life. Reduced calorie
			requirements from not moving much means that you can survive on far
			less food than those villagers starving to death at the base of your
			holy mountain. Living at such great heights also makes it harder for
			roaming bandits to come and kill you in your sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a

			width="162" height="240" alt="kombucha light"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest
			oriental potion boasting mystical properties that I've encounter is
			kombucha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia says: "Kombucha is the
			Western name for sweetened tea or tisane that has been fermented
			using a macroscopic solid mass of microorganisms called a kombucha
			colony."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the recent introduction of
			this drink to the US stems from the popularity of probiotic drinks
			and other microbe infested foods that are purported to support
			well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a

			width="240" height="161" alt="kombucha bullcrap"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have no
			problem whatsoever with claims of reasonable health benefits but the
			label of this drink goes a bit far, forcing me take the &lt;a
			href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDW_Hj2K0wo"&gt;Bill Hicks
			stance on marketing&lt;/a&gt;. What we have here is essentially a
			soft drink. There is a decent amount of good nutrients loaded into
			this little bottle but you also get a dose of added sugar (which,
			admittedly, is significantly smaller than what one typically
			encounters in most soft drinks). So you can pack the mini-fridge next
			to the couch with these things to your heart's content but kombucha
			alone is not going to do anything for your longevity.&lt;br

			width="240" height="161" alt="kombucha ingredients"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spurious claims
			aside, this commercial implementation of the kombucha recipe is
			marvelously flavorful. It tastes like a lightly carbonated ginger
			sweet tea which is funny because it's actually a lightly carbonated
			ginger sweet tea with magic microorganisms (they apparently don't add
			much to the taste).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't remember how much
			this was because I received it as a gift but expect a high price tag
			attached to those mystical properties, even if you are just buying it
			for the taste.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img

		<title type='text'>Elvis Sandwich</title>
		<content type='html'>Edible Oddities is proud to announce the very
			first episode in an exciting new series called Creating Culinary
			Abominations! Not really, but this is the first post where we run you
			through the process of making the disgusting food before consuming
			it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abandoning the sleek figure and
			sex-symbol status of his young life, Elvis Aaron Presley became a
			bloated fat man throughout the years leading to his demise and it's
			no surprise (his fatness or his death) considering what he was
			eating. One of his favorite foods, a fried peanut butter and banana
			sandwich, appropriately dubbed the Elvis sandwich, has attained a
			cult status all of its own. As with most cult figures, including the
			barking fat man himself, there are many different theories and
			conflicting ideas floating around about this iconic snack. Some claim
			the sandwich also contained bacon and, instead of being fried in
			butter on a hot skillet, the left-over bacon grease was used to do
			the dirty work. So, in the spirit of going that extra mile for an
			extra disturbing experience, I thought why not try both? Half with
			bacon and half without for that simultaneously authentic and awful
			experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's what you will need for one
			sandwich:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 slices of white bread&lt;br /&gt;1
			banana&lt;br /&gt;peanut butter&lt;br /&gt;butter&lt;br /&gt;3-5
			slices of bacon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3088794355/"

			width="161" height="240" alt="toasting bread"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start by toasting
			your bread. Don't make it too dark since the sandwich is going to be
			charred a bit more during the frying process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3089631364/" title="cut

			width="240" height="140" alt="cut banana"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut your banana
			into relatively thin slices. This will ensure the sandwich fits
			together tightly and if you want your bananas thick you can always
			layer them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a

			width="240" height="161" alt="cooking bacon"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, start cooking
			your bacon. Keep that grease, we can use it to fry the sandwich
			later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a

			width="240" height="120" alt="elvis sandwich ingredients"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toast should
			be done so, while the bacon is cooking, spread the peanut butter
			thickly over one piece of the toast. Although the authentic recipe
			only calls for one piece to be subjected to the peanut butter
			treatment, you can do both pieces if you'd like. Doing so will
			probably help the sandwich stick together better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a

			width="240" height="236" alt="elvis sandwich pre frying"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the bacon is
			done cooking, keep the grease warm while you collect the ingredients
			and assemble them together. Again, we were doing half of the sandwich
			with bacon and half without. Whether you use bacon at all is entirely
			up to your personal preferences and gastrointestinal fortitude.&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a

			width="240" height="161" alt="elvis sandwich"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grab your
			assembled sandwich, press firmly, and drop it into the cooking
			grease. If you find that there isn't enough grease to do a sufficient
			frying job then butter the outsides of the bread. Once peanut butter
			starts oozing out of a disgustingly crispy and greasy sandwich then
			you know you're done. Whip that sandwich out of the frying pan and
			get yourself excited whilst letting it cool down a bit.&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a

			title="elvis sandwich close up by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img

			width="240" height="156" alt="elvis sandwich close up"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's nothing
			truly horrific about the taste of the Elvis sandwich. The bacon fits
			surprisingly well with the banana/peanut butter mush, which by itself
			is also quite nice. Overall, the sandwich is pleasantly flavorful
			albeit in a disturbing way. But with such high levels of fats and
			carbohydrates you can almost feel yourself going into shock. Sure, as
			animals we are supposed to be uncontrollably drawn to foods with high
			calorific content but this is almost too much. A few bites into this
			beast and you'll be fighting the urge to bring it all back up
			again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn't finish the entire sandwich,
			leaving a large corner of the bread untouched despite still feeling a
			bit hungry. I can imagine eating a couple of these things and not
			being satisfied due to the lack of bulk but I felt so disgusting
			after my one that I didn't want to eat another thing for the entirety
			of the day. Still, this is something adventurous eaters should
			definitely try. Once. I can't fathom how anybody can eat more than
			one of these in a lifetime, much less with any regularity, but there
			is ample photographic evidence depicting what happens when you
			do.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1'

		<title type='text'>soan papdi / patisa</title>
		<content type='html'>The formal education system of the Western
			world, the United States in particular, unjustly neglects to pay much
			attention to the rich culture and history of India besides giving a
			cursory nod to Gandhi and the Indian Independence movement and that's
			only because a movie was made about the period. Now that I mention
			it, almost everything I "learned" about the history of other
			countries throughout my time in the American primary education system
			had some sort of movie tie in. There was "Gandhi" for India, "The
			Last Emperor" for China, "Nicholas and Alexandra" for Russia, and
			"Excalibur" because the fictional account of British history is
			somehow more relevant than the actual history (of which we learned
			naught). If I remember correctly, think we might have even watched
			"Braveheart" because everyone knows that it's an accurate portrayal
			of Scottish history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3067292111/"
			title="soan papdi box by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3001/3067292111_2fb01bb4ec_m.jpg"
			width="240" height="125" alt="soan papdi box"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to
			India, the seventh largest country in terms of land mass yet the
			second most populous country in the world with over one billion
			people. A smattering of Indian cuisine has been assimilated by the
			Western world with curry crossing culinary borders into all sorts of
			foods, Mulligatawny soup appearing on both menus and sitcoms, and
			naan bread gracing the shelves of the local supermarket. But, in a
			place with over a billion people and more than a thousand languages
			(29 of which have at least a million native speakers each), there's
			bound to be more that we're missing out on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;One class of foods that haven't quite made the mass exodus are
			sweets and confections. Now, I love curries and could easily eat
			traditional Indian meals daily but I'm not a fan of desserts hailing
			from any of the world's many nations. However, given that I've
			enjoyed all of my Indian food experiences, I gladly accepted my
			friend and colleague's offer to try some of his cherished sweet:
			patisa (aka soan papdi, sohan papdi, or sohan halva).&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3068129530/"
			title="soan papdi close by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3282/3068129530_fb78a73218_m.jpg"
			width="240" height="161" alt="soan papdi close"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in
			this confection are sugar, gram flour, sugar, flour, sugar, ghee,
			sugar, milk, sugar, and cardamom. First a quick explanation of some
			of the ingredients foreign to the Western world: Gram flour is a
			flour made from chickpeas/garbanzo beans. Think dehydrated hummus
			without the tahini (sesame seed paste). Ghee is a clarified butter
			and is a very important ingredient in Indian cultures. It is used for
			culinary, medicinal, spiritual, and even cosmetic purposes. Rather
			than attempt, and subsequently fail, at piecing together a proper
			explanation of this substance, here's a quote from &lt;a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghee"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;quote&gt;"Ghee is made by simmering unsalted
			butter in a large pot until all water has boiled off and protein has
			settled to the bottom. The cooked and clarified butter is then
			spooned off to avoid disturbing the milk solids on the bottom of the
			pan. Unlike butter, ghee can be stored for extended periods without
			refrigeration, provided it is kept in an airtight container to
			prevent oxidation and remains moisture-free."&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resultant dish is a giant block of dry, flaky,
			meringue-like confection. It's fairly difficult to pick a segment up
			when the slightest pressure causes it to crumble. If you are able to
			manage getting a piece in your mouth you will find this strange
			substance instantaneously melts upon reaching its destination.
			Despite the apparent dryness during handling, the fats and oils from
			the ghee come to the forefront when mixed with your saliva producing
			a creamy texture and flavor. The initial experience is very pleasant
			and stimulates that cream-loving beast locked within each of us.
			However, the situation quickly falls apart for me when the second
			wave hits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sugar. There's so much of it in
			this dish that I could almost feel my pancreas convulsing
			uncontrollably and screaming "don't glaze me, bro." Being somewhat
			sensitive to things high in sugar, I was afraid that I had gone too
			far given myself insta-diabetes, like the tragic teenage drug-addict
			who either gets hooked or overdoses during their first curious
			self-experiment. And like the young addict, I found myself intensely
			craving the stuff a mere five minutes later. "Just one more try,"
			said the trembling inner voice, "one more little bite won't hurt."
			Temporarily weakened by the thought of the lovely creamy taste and
			sensation, I picked a small piece up and popped it into my waiting
			mouth. Oh creamy bliss, but again there was the second onslaught of
			sugar and I had to resolve never to eat the stuff again out of fear
			for my health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a

			width="240" height="161" alt="soan papdi top"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also sampled
			another dish similar to the patisa / soan papdi but this was more
			milky and needed refrigeration. It inhabited a realm somewhere
			between ice cream and cottage cheese in appearance and consistency.
			It also had a very nice flavor but was, again, loaded with an
			incredible amount of sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For health reasons
			I'm going to have to stay away from these tasty treats but anyone
			with a sweet tooth is sure to enjoy them. I will, however, visit one
			of the many local Indian grocers in the near future and stock up on
			some other interesting foods so that I can further offend an entire

		<title type='text'>Fried Green Tomatoes / Yellow Tomatoes</title>
		<content type='html'>Tomatoes are my favorite fruit. But they're a
			vegetable, you say. Fruits are sweet and are thus appropriately
			artificially approximated as flavors for candy. Even the United
			States Supreme Court ruled in 1893 that tomatoes are to be labeled,
			and therefore taxed, as vegetables. But the term vegetable is not
			scientific and, biologically, a fruit is defined as the ripened ovary
			of a flowering plant, the simple defining characteristic being the
			seeds. But regardless of what you want to call it, I think the tomato
			is grand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="240" height="161" alt="fried green tomatoes"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One oddity
			involving tomatoes that I had long been interested in sampling was
			the fried green variety. Most fruits are strictly off limits for
			consumption prior to ripening due to the tough texture, bitter
			flavor, and occasional toxicity. Cooking an unripe fruit can take
			care of the hard texture and alter the flavor to a more palatable
			form. One such treatment is the Southern favorite, fried green
			tomatoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being of Australian origin and
			British descent, when I think "fried tomato" I think of a few naked
			slices of tomato fried up in sausage grease, part of a traditional
			English breakfast. Suffice to say, I was a little confused when I
			received my order of fried green tomatoes at Savannah's wonderful
			&lt;a href="http://www.moonriverbrewing.com/"&gt;Moon River
			Brewery&lt;/a&gt; (highly recommended if you're in the area) and
			quickly realized how obviously mistaken I had been to think they
			wouldn't be breaded. The breading, in my opinion, masks the full
			flavor of the green tomato so I ripped the outer covering from one of
			the bunch to fully appreciate the taste. With the breading they
			tasted much like other fried fruits and veggies like fried okra and
			even onion rings. Naked, however, the flavor was more distinctly
			"tomato" yet with some of the pungency one finds in the vegetation of
			the plant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not being a fan of battered and
			fried foods, I think I'll steer clear of these in the future but I
			might experiment with my own pan-fried green tomatoes to see how they
			compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="161" height="240" alt="yellow tomato halves"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the green
			tomato is simply an unripe red tomato, over the past few years we
			have seen an increase in the number of tomato cultivars being offered
			by supermarkets which include some odd colored and strangely shaped
			varieties. Recently I picked up a yellow tomato thinking that the
			extraordinarily high price tag would correlate to an extraordinarily
			wonderful tomato.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="240" height="175" alt="yellow tomato + red close"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note the
			difference between the two tomatoes above. One is of a typical red
			tomato hue, the other inhabits a more orange/yellow position in the
			spectrum. But if you're thinking that's the only difference between
			the two, well then, you're just plain right. The yellow cultivar was
			really no different from a red of comparable quality. There may have
			been a slight difference in certain components of the flavor but
			these were only very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's my advice
			for anyone who loves tomatoes as much as I do: grow your own. I have
			never bought a tomato from the store that has been anywhere near as
			amazing in odor, flavor, and texture as those I've pulled off the
			plant myself. Even when they're scabbed and mottled, the amazing
			succulence and intense flavor put any of the store bought varieties
			to shame... yes, even those from high-end, over-priced organic
			markets. They're relatively easy to grow and incredibly rewarding.
			Just watch out for the &lt;a

		<title type='text'>Cherimoya</title>
		<content type='html'>"The most delicious fruit known to men,"
			proclaimed Mark Twain in The Sacramento Daily Union on October 25,
			1866. While he may be right, the cherimoya is certainly one of the
			ugliest too. I have a sneaking suspicion that these things are
			actually the eggs of the reptilian humanoids purported by small bands
			of delusional neanderthals to be in control of the world's
			governments and financial systems. If my theory is correct then I,
			for one, welcome our delicious reptilian overlords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3023361815/"

			width="240" height="161" alt="cherimoya"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The official story
			our government wants us to believe is that cherimoyas are fruits
			native to the Andean-highland valleys of Ecuador and Peru and
			currently produced throughout many temperate regions throughout the
			world. The trees don't like frost and snow but thrive in cooler
			temperatures, leading to the indigenous peoples of the Andes to claim
			that, "while the cherimoya cannot stand snow, it does like to see it
			in the distance."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin of a cherimoya is
			soft and smooth, not unlike that of a reptile, and the sweet perfume
			of the flesh comes through slightly, entirely unlike that of a
			reptile. Cutting the fruit open reveals a creamy white interior and
			some very large brown seeds, an appearance that could partly explain
			why it is also commonly called a custard apple. The flesh is actually
			segmented into velvety pods that each contain a single seed and can
			be peeled out intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a
			href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oliverdodd/3023361887/"
			title="cherimoya cut by oliver.dodd, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img
			src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3168/3023361887_71d37892d1_m.jpg"
			width="240" height="161" alt="cherimoya cut"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to
			eat neither seed nor skin. The seeds are poisonous if cracked and can
			be crushed up for use as an insecticide. Even better, eating the skin
			can result in paralysis for a period of 4 to 5 hours. Learning of
			this only made me want to try it but I didn't want to chance having
			my diaphragm or heart paralyzed. Death by cherimoya may be exotic but
			definitely not too glamorous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Twain has a
			fairly solid case for proclaiming the cherimoya the most delicious of
			fruits. The closest comparison I can draw to the flavor is a well
			made, not-too-sweet, non-alcoholic pi&amp;ntilde;a colada but really
			this does no justice to the complexities and smoothness of the
			flavor. The sweetness teeters on the safe side of being overbearing
			so that no matter how many pieces of velvety flesh you eat the taste
			does not become tiresome. There are hints of banana, pineapple, &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2008/06/feijoa.html"&gt;feijoa&lt;/a&gt;,
			and &lt;a
			href="http://edible-oddities.blogspot.com/2008/09/dragon-fruit.html"&gt;dragon
			fruit&lt;/a&gt;. The texture, sweetness, and flavors also bear a
			striking resemblance to bubblegum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div
			style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a

			width="161" height="240" alt="cherimoya seed"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major
			drawbacks to the cherimoya are its relative rareness, small window of
			availability, and high price. Five bucks a pound was what they were
			going for at my local store and my insane cheapness prevented me from
			buying more than my initial sample. But I can imagine that the
			passage of time until next season will compound my craving and leave
			me compelled to indulge in this succulent fruit once more.&lt;div

		<title type='text'>Mochi/Daifuku</title>
		<content type='html'>mochi/daifuku&lt;br /&gt;2008-11-28&lt;br
			/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can tell a lot about the agriculture and staple
			food items of a region by taking a cursory glance at their sweets,
			snacks, and liquor. Here in the USA, land of the almighty corn
			kernel, everything is sweetened with corn syrup, we stuff our faces
			with corn chips, most American beer contains some amount of corn, and
			proper Bourbon, arguably the most American of spirits, is made
			exclusively from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="240" height="161" alt="moshi side"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To quote the late,
			great novelist, Kurt Vonnegut Jr.: "Harold Newcomb Wilbur got his
			medals for killing Japanese, who were yellow robots. They were fueled
			by rice." If you can wrap rice around a stick of raw fish and call it
			dinner then it's not too strange an idea to pummel it into a paste
			and call it desert. This paste, called mochi, is used as a base for
			many confections and sweets in Japanese candies. One common
			preparation, called daifuku, involves rolling the mochi into a ball
			and stuffing it with a sweet paste made from the red azuki
			beans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red beans and rice, eh? Sounds like the
			only other side item at a Cuban restaurant besides fried plantains,
			not a piece of candy. But trust me, this little ball of sweetness is
			a lot nicer than it sounds, sort of like the japanese version of a
			jelly donut except that eating a couple won't put you into a diabetic
			coma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"What the hell is that crap?"&lt;br
			/&gt;"Mochi!" chirped my chipper Chinese colleague, thrusting the box
			in my face. I reluctantly grabbed a piece and retreated to my sanctum
			for closer inspection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div

			width="240" height="161" alt="moshi bit"
			/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weirdest thing
			about my little mochi/daifuku sample was the strange covering of
			blackened sesame seeds, seaweed, and lint with some little green
			balls that, keeping in mind all of the unsettling ingredients in the
			sushi I've eaten in the past, are probably best left unidentified. I
			wasn't expecting much at all from this little morsel, particularly
			since previous experiences with Asian candies and snacks have been
			less than wonderful. With facial muscles tensed, I took my first
			bite... not bad, not bad at all. Having demolished half of my ration
			in one solitary nibble, I was saddened to see how little I had left
			to savor. Even without the strange outer coverings the mochi and red
			bean paste filling would have been a nice, subtly sweet treat but the
			addition of the complex savory flavors and crunchy texture made it a
			lot more interesting on the whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going
			to have to hit up a local Asian food market for some interesting eats
			in the near future and, despite not being a big fan of sweets, I can
			definitely see myself picking up some more of these to stuff my face
